## Scope

Files audited: **16** under `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/finance-*.ts`.
Endpoints: **263** total, **134** writes.

## Dimensions evaluated

| # | Dimension | Static check |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | RBAC          | every handler is wrapped by `authorize({ feature, action })` |
| 2 | Scope         | list endpoints use `parseScopeFilters` + `buildScopedWhere` ; detail/write reference `scope.companyId` |
| 3 | Audit         | every write endpoint calls `createAuditLog` (or routes via `applyTransition` which emits audit internally) |
| 4 | Events        | every write endpoint calls `emitEvent` / `safeEmitEvent` (or via `applyTransition`) |
| 5 | Lifecycle     | status-flipping endpoints route through `applyTransition` rather than raw `UPDATE … SET status = …` |
| 6 | GL bridge     | financial write endpoints in GL-relevant files reference a journal posting helper (`postJournalEntry`, `finance-gl-helpers`, `finance-algorithms`) |

Out of scope (Phase 5): concurrency / locking correctness, large-dataset performance, real GL posting end-to-end, multi-tenant runtime isolation.
