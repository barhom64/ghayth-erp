# Finance Module Static Certification

Generated: 2026-05-19

> **Read-only.** Regenerate with

> here is one of `PASS` / `PARTIAL` / `FAIL` / `SKIP`;
> non-PASS cells should turn into an issue or a small PR.

## Scope

Files audited: **16** under `artifacts/api-server/src/routes/finance-*.ts`.
Endpoints: **229** total, **119** writes.

## Dimensions evaluated

| # | Dimension | Static check |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | RBAC          | every handler is wrapped by `authorize({ feature, action })` |
| 2 | Scope         | list endpoints use `parseScopeFilters` + `buildScopedWhere` ; detail/write reference `scope.companyId` |
| 3 | Audit         | every write endpoint calls `createAuditLog` (or routes via `applyTransition` which emits audit internally) |
| 4 | Events        | every write endpoint calls `emitEvent` / `safeEmitEvent` (or via `applyTransition`) |
| 5 | Lifecycle     | status-flipping endpoints route through `applyTransition` rather than raw `UPDATE … SET status = …` |
| 6 | GL bridge     | financial write endpoints in GL-relevant files reference a journal posting helper (`postJournalEntry`, `finance-gl-helpers`, `finance-algorithms`) |

Out of scope (Phase 5): concurrency / locking correctness, large-dataset performance, real GL posting end-to-end, multi-tenant runtime isolation.

  - `finance-zatca.ts` — 3
  - `finance-algorithms.ts` — 2
  - `finance-cost-centers.ts` — 1
  - `finance-custodies.ts` — 1

- **fromState graph mismatches** on Finance files: **1** hits (after PR #667 closes 1).
  - `finance-invoices.ts:587` — invoices sent → approved
